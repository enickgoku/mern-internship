# Getting Started with Create React App

This Project was created for the purpose of serving as an application for a MERN stack position. This project uses the development environment and not an outside database.

## Available Scripts

To start this project you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will need to have yarn installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable). You will need to have MongoDB installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). You will need to have the Mongo Shell installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/mongo/).

## From the command line run the following commands:

(Notes for MacOS)

\*\*

mongod

if you have a db folder in your Users/user/data directory. If you do not have a data folder, you will need to create one and run: mongod --dbpath ~/data/db

note: I have had to run the second command in order to get the mongo server to start. If you have a data folder in your User directory, you can run the first command and should be good to go.

this will start the mongo server on your machine.
